# RedissonHandler
 Opensource Redisson Handler designed for people that are newer to redis and still wish to use it to sync data cross server /    send messages cross server.
 You can find examples in the examples package if theirs any issues with it feel free to report them and I'll look into them as soon as I have time to do so.

(stop using redisson or i'll deadass slap joe)
